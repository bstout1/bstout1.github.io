## Interests

I love learning, exploring and building. My one word description is "curious". Right now I am working on privacy technologies, verifiable computing, and mathematically-enabling technologies. My current interests are number theory, zero knowledge cryptography, game theory, MEV, and Austrian economics.

For the last five years I have worked as a corporate restructuring professional on bankruptcy trade claims. Corporate restructuring is a fascinating world of information, incentives, and markets. About the same time I started tinkering in Solidity. I'm particularly interested in cryptoeconomics and how zero knowledge technologies can be used to reduce MEV. About half of my free time I think about these concepts, work on understanding different protocols and commitment schemes. The other half of the time I think about large language models and prompt engineering. I'm particularly interested in how these can be used to augment knowledge driven-industries, like corporate restructuring. I'm working with tools like LangChain, LlamaIndex, webscraping, Pinecone.

## Things I'm Working On

## What I've Been Learning
- Zero knowledge cryptography. I've completed the Stanford Zero Knowledge Proof MOOC [here](https://zk-learning.org), the Encoe ZK Bootcamp., and the MIT ZK IAP [here](https://zkiap.com/). I'm working on learning Circom.
- Solidity. I'm interested in MEV and how ZK cryptography can be used to reduce bad MEV. I completed the Encode Solidity Foundation and Eolidity Expert Bootcamps. I'm also interested in decentralized market building.
- Generative AI applications. I'm building tools with LangChain and OpenAI to help creditors in restructuring.
